    <h1>Pine Tree</h1>

    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pines are some of the best-known plants around the world.</li>
        <li>They possess huge economic importance through the timber trade and are easily identifiable due to their characteristic cone-shaped growth form and needle-like leaves.</li>
        <li>Pines usually have male and female cones on the same tree (monoecious). They fall as soon as they have shed their pollen.</li>
        <li>The pines are a family of around 250 woody, seed-producing plants.</li>
        <li>They include conifers such as cedars, spruces, firs and pines.</li>
        <li>Of all the conifers, the pines have one of the largest distributions although they are found almost entirely in the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
        <li>Many species have the ability to withstand burning.</li>
        <li>Their thick layer of bark helps to protect the tree during fires and prevent burning of vulnerable woody tissue.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Found in: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pines live in almost the entire Northern Hemisphere.</li>
        <li>In North America, they live in the southern part of Arctic to Nicaragua and Hispaniola.</li>
        <li>In Europe, they live in areas from Portugal and Scotland to Russia.</li>
        <li>In Asia, they live in areas from Russia to Japan and the Philippines.</li>
        <li>They also live in the Himalayas, some northern parts of Africa, and north of Majorca (Mallorca) on the rugged mountains.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Uses in Forestry: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Timber and paper industries around the world are built around the growth of planted pine forests.</li>
        <li>Timber is an essential building material all around the world, both in first and third world countries; and paper has been used for various purposes for hundreds of years.</li>
        <li>Pines are the dominant trees grown in the majority of countries for both the timber and paper industries and have been critical in both of these multi-billion dollar industries.</li>
