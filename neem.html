    <h1>Neem Tree</h1>
    <img src="neem.jpg" alt="Banyan Tree" width="30%" height="50%">
    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Neem trees are attractive broad-leaved evergreens that can grow up to 30 m tall and 2.5 m in girth.</li>
        <li>Their spreading branches form rounded crowns as much as 20 m across.</li>
        <li>They remain in leaf except during extreme drought, when the leaves may fall off.</li>
        <li>The short, usually straight trunk has a moderately thick, strongly furrowed bark.</li>
        <li>The roots penetrate the soil deeply, at least where the site permits, and, particularly when injured, they produce suckers.</li>
        <li>This suckering tends to be especially prolific in dry localities.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Grow a Neem Tree: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Neem is a hardy tree that can tolerate temperatures up to 50 &#176C.</li>
        <li>However, extended cool weather with temperatures below 5 &#176C will cause the tree to drop its leaves.</li>
        <li>The tree wonâ€™t tolerate colder temperatures, wet climates, or prolonged drought.</li>
        <li>That being said, if you can locate fresh neem tree seeds, you can grow a tree indoors in a pot filled with good quality, well-drained potting soil.</li>
        <li>Outdoors, plant fresh neem seeds directly in the ground, or start them in trays or pots and transplant them outdoors at about three months.</li>
        <li>If you have access to mature trees, you can root the cuttings in late fall or early winter.</li>
        <li>Neem Tree Growth and Care Neem trees require plenty of bright sunlight.</li>
        <li>The trees benefit from regular moisture, but be careful not to overwater, as the tree wonâ€™t tolerate wet feet or poorly drained soil.</li>
        <li>Allow the soil to dry between every watering.</li>
        <li>Feed the tree about once a month in spring and summer, using a light application of any good quality, balanced fertilizer or a dilute solution of water-soluble fertilizer.</li>
   </ol>
    <h2>Uses As a Vegetable: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Neem leaves are dried in India and placed in cupboards to prevent insects eating the clothes, and also in tins where rice is stored.</li>
        <li>The flowers are also used in many Indian festivals like Ugadi.</li>
        <li>tender shoots and flowers of the neem tree are eaten as a vegetable in India.</li>
        <li>A soup-like dish called veppampoo charu in Tamil (translated as "neem flower rasam") made of the flower of neem is prepared in Tamil Nadu.</li>
        <li>In Bengal, young neem leaves are fried in oil with tiny pieces of eggplant (brinjal).The dish is called neem begun bhaja.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Uses As A Medicine: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Products made from neem trees have been used in the traditional medicine of India for centuries, but there is insufficient clinical evidence to indicate any benefits of using neem for medicinal purposes.</li>
        <li>In adults, no specific doses have been established, and short-term use of neem appears to be safe, while long-term use may harm the kidneys or liver; in small children, neem oil is toxic and can even lead to death.</li>
        <li>Neem may also cause miscarriages, infertility, and low blood sugar.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Uses As a Pest: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Neem is a key ingredient in non-pesticidal management (NPM), providing a natural alternative to synthetic pesticides.</li>
        <li>Neem seeds are ground into powder that is soaked overnight in water and sprayed on the crop.</li>
        <li>To be effective, it must be applied repeatedly, at least every ten days.</li>
        <li>Neem does not directly kill insects.</li>
        <li>It acts as an anti-feedant, repellent, and egg-laying deterrent and thus protects the crop from damage.</li>
        <li>The insects starve and die within a few days.</li>
        <li>Neem also suppresses the subsequent hatching of their eggs.</li>
        <li>Neem-based fertilizers have been effective against southern armyworm. Neem cake is often sold as a fertilizer.</li>
        <li>Neem oil has been shown to avert termite attack as an ecofriendly and economical agent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Other Uses: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tree: the neem tree is of great importance for its anti-desertification properties and possibly as a good carbon dioxide sink. It is also used for maintaining soil fertility.</li>
        <li>Fertilizer: neem extract is added to fertilizers (urea) as a nitrification inhibitor.</li>
        <li>Animal feed: neem leaves can be occasionally used as forage for ruminants and rabbits.</li>
        <li>Teeth cleaning: neem has traditionally been used as a type of teeth-cleaning twig.</li>
    </ol>
<h2>Found in: </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Neem tree is found throughout India as a popular village tree.</li>
    <li>It is also widely grown in Ranthambore National Park, Bandhavgarh national Park, Mrugavani Naional Park, Bannerghata National Park, Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary and Guindy National Park.</li>
